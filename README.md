# ü©∫ **VaidyAI: Your Personal Medical AI Assistant**

## üìå Overview

**VaidyAI** is a sophisticated, secure, and user-friendly medical AI assistant built using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture. It's designed to provide compassionate, accurate, and context-aware medical information. The system features a secure authentication layer, persistent chat history, and an intuitive web interface, making it a reliable tool for preliminary medical queries.

The application is split into two main components: a powerful **FastAPI** backend that handles AI logic and data management, and an interactive **Streamlit** frontend for a seamless user experience.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Advanced RAG Pipeline**: Utilizes a FAISS vector store and a powerful LLM (Llama 3.1 via Groq) to provide answers based on a verified medical knowledge base.
-   **Secure User Authentication**: Full registration and login system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure, session-based access.
-   **Persistent Conversation History**: Chat histories are stored per-user in a MongoDB database, allowing users to resume or review past conversations.
-   **Multi-lingual & Empathetic Responses**: The AI is prompted to respond in English, Hindi, or Hinglish, adopting a compassionate and reassuring "doctor-like" tone.
-   **Full Chat Management**: Users can create new chats, switch between old conversations, and securely delete their chat history.
-   **Interactive Web Interface**: A clean, responsive, and easy-to-use chat interface built with Streamlit.
-   **Scalable Backend**: The FastAPI backend is asynchronous-ready, robust, and handles all core business logic efficiently.
